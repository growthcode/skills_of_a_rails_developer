  # Remove at index thought process.. To remove a node at a particular index I simply need to make the node before it point to the node after it. There will be no way to access it anymore and garbage collection should delete it. You can only look forward and never backwards in a linked list. With this in mind if I walk all the way to the node I want to remove I can't look back to modify the node before it like I need to. I will walk to the node just before the one I want to delete and make its 'next' pointer hop over the node I wish to delete and point at its next.
