Implement LinkedList#sort (I shouldn’t have to say it, but I will – NO ARRAYS!)

LinkedList#sort sorts a Linked List, with nodes whose values are all integers, from smallest to largest based on node value. It accepts no arguments, and it returns a sorted LinkedList object.
list=[1,0,3,2,5,4,7,6]
list.sort # returns LinkedList object [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
