#Is Value in Binary Search Tree?

Write the function *is_value_present?* that takes the root node of a ***binary search tree*** and an integer as arguments and returns true or false if the integer is in the tree. 

[Here's code for a binary search tree generator for testing, but you should really make your own in the end :)](https://github.com/adowns01/Intro-to-Whiteboarding-DBC/blob/master/solutions/bst_generator.rb)
