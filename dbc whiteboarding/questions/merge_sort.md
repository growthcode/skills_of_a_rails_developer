#Merge Sort

Merge sort is considered a “divide and conquer” sorting algorithm. Write a recursive method that utilizes merge sort.

Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:

1. Divide the unsorted list into n sub-lists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted). (base case?)

2. Repeatedly merge sub-lists to produce new, sorted sub-lists until there is only 1 sub-list remaining. This will be the sorted list.
