#Missing number

There is a [natural number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number) series (1..n, positive integers) but missing one somewhere in the middle, please write a method to find what is the missing number.

Example:
```Ruby
missing_number([1, 3, 4, 5, 6])    # => 2
missing_number([1, 2, 3, 4, 6])    # => 5
```

Hint: the input is incremental, continuous number series.

Please write two different solutions and discuss Big(O) in time and space
