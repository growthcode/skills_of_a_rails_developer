#Apple Stocks

You have an array *stock_prices_yesterday* that contains the value of apple stocks at minute intervals starting at 9:30am.    

For example:    
  *stock_prices_yesterday[0]* is the price of the stock at 9:30am     
  *stock_prices_yesterday[1]* is the price of the stock at 9:31am   
  *stock_prices_yesterday[2]* is the price of the stock at 9:32am   
  etc

Determine the greatest profit you could have made yesterday. 

Note that you can't just find the max and min of the array and subtract them becasue you cannot sell stock until you buy it. 

What is the time and space complexity of your solution?
