#Majority Element

There is one dominant cadidate (more than 50%) in a vote, please help count ballots to find the winner.

Example:
```Ruby
majority_element([1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1])    # => 1
majority_element([3, 1, 2, 2, 2])          # => 2
```

Extra: check Boyer’s linear time solution of majority vote

Please write two different solutions and discuss Big(O) in time and space
