#Recursive polynomial

Write a method to expand nth polynomial, for example:
- (a+b)<sup>0</sup> = 1
- (a+b)<sup>1</sup> = a<sup>1</sup> + b<sup>1</sup>
- (a+b)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + 2ab + b<sup>2</sup>
- (a+b)<sup>3</sup> = a<sup>3</sup> + 3a<sup>2</sup>*b + 3a*b<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>3</sup>

The above question seems scary, but it actually is only asking for Pascal's triangle:

```
1
1   1
1   2   1
1   3   3   1
1   4   6   4   1
.....
```

* a: Please write a method to calculate the value at a given row/column in Pascal's triangle ( e.g. pascal(4,2)=6 )
* b: Please write a method to print out the entire triangle from 1 to nth level.
