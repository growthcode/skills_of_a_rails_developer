#The Lonely Number

There are a bunch of numbers in an array. One of these numbers occurs once in the array. Other numbers occur at least twice. 

Write a function that returns the lonely integer.

Example: [2,6,3,8,6,2,3]
Returns:  8     


***REMEMBER***
- Did you Brute Force?
- Did you nail down edge cases?
- Can you draw a picture?
- Did you walk through your code with test data?
- Can you use a hash?
