#Is Prime?

Write the method is_prime? that takes one integer as an argument and returns true if the integer is a prime. Do not use the Ruby method #prime? . 

Explain the time and space complexity of your algorithm.

**Hint:** A number is prime if it is an integer greater than one that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. 

**Examples:**
```ruby
is_prime?(2) #=> true
is_prime?(6) #=> false
```

**Bonus:** Can you improve your algorithm by memoizing it?
