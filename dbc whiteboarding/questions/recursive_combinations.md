#Recursive Combinations

How many combinations of 5 people can be formed from 20? How about combinations of 3 from 18? 

Write a recursive method to calculate the number of combinations of k people from a choice of n people. Order doesn’t matter.

```Ruby
combinations(5, 3)    # => 10
```

Hint: combinations(n, k) = combinations(n – 1, k – 1) + combinations(n – 1, k)

Figure out the base case!
