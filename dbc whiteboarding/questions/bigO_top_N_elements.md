#Top N elements

Here are some random numbers, please write your own method to find what are the biggeist/top 3 numbers, just like Ruby's #max(3) method.

Examples:
```Ruby
top_n_elements(23, 45, 67, 14, 98, 73, 39)  # => 98, 73, 67
top_n_elements(4, 6)                        # => 4, 6
```

Hint:  This is a classical k largest(or smallest) elements in an array question.

In one language of your choice, please try to come up with 2 different solutions. please discuss Big(O), compare the trade-off with your interviewers.
