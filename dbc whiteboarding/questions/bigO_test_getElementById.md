#Test getElementById()

[Document.getElementById()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById) is a Javascript function to fetch a DOM element by HTML id attribute. Code some HTML and Javascript, discuss with your interviewers how would you test the time complexity of getElementById() implementation under the hood.

Hint1: First, create *two different HTML/DOM* containing an element with a specific id.  What's the time difference of applying Document.getElementById() on these two HTML/DOM?

Hint2: Different browsers could apply different implementations of getElementById().
