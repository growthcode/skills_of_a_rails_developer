#Palindrome

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward. Allowances may be made for adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers. e. g. "Nixon", "race car"

Please write a method to check if a given string palindrome.

BONUS: solve this using recusion

```Ruby
is_palindrome?("No X in Nixon")    # => True
```
