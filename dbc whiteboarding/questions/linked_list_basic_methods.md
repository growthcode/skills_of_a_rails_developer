Implement three basic methods (#[], #insert, #remove) in the LinkedList class. Do not use any arrays in these methods!

-LinkedList#[] accepts one argument which is an integer representing the position in the linked list of the node you want, and returns the Node object at that position

-LinkedList#insert accepts two arguments which are an instance of the Node class and an integer representing the position in the list at which the node is to be inserted, and returns the Node object that was inserted

-LinkedList#remove accepts one argument which is an “index” number in the linked list, and returns the Node object which is removed from the LinkedList
