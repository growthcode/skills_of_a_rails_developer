#Biased Random Generator

Write a method to generate weighted random numbers by giving output numbers and output percentages.

Example:
```Ruby
weighted_random([1,2,3], [10, 30, 60])    # => 1 or 2 or 3

# If running it many times
# roughly 10% of the output random number would be 1,
# roughly 30% of the output random number would be 2,
# roughly 60% of the output random number would be 3.
```

Hint: check reservoir sampling or rejection sampling.

Please write two different solutions and discuss Big(O) in time and space
