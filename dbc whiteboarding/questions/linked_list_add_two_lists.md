## Add two linked lists

You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reversed order, such that the 1â€™s digit is at the head of the list. Write a function, add_two_lists, that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
Example:
Input: (3 => 1 => 5), (5 => 9 => 2) # represent 513, 295
Output: 8 => 0 => 8 # represent 808
